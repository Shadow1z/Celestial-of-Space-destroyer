The game is based on Space invaders, but it is quite different. It has some of the core features.

To run the program, run the file called main.py.

This game was coded in Python, using a range of modules such as Pygame and Tkinter for example. 
The code is not every efficient or 'perfect'. 

Once the main.py is running, a login page will be presented, where you can create an account or login in with a previously made account.
This step is important as the username made will be used for the leaderboard, where the scores are displayed.
Note that, if the user closes the login page, the game will not run as well, and will close. So to run the game, you must login in before.

After logging in, the Main Menu will appear, where the leaderboard is shown. There will also be two options for the player to choose from, 'Quit', closes the game. The other is 'Start', this will change
the game state to 'Playing', and the actual game will start. 

In the game, the player can move left and right, by pressing the left and right arrow key. To shoot, press spacebar. Note that there is a cooldown to how many bullets the player can shoot at once.
To pause the game, press the Esc key. 

In the pause when the player can resume the game, or quit back to Main Menu. 

There is a health bar under the player's spaceship, the shows the remaining health of the player's spaceship.
If the player shoots all the aliens down, then the next level/wave will start. Each time the difficult will increase.

If the player is shot by three alien bullets, then their remaining health will become zero. This will change the gamestate to 'Gameover', presenting the gameover screen. 
On the gameover screen the player can quit the game or restart it again.

I plan to add a lot more features, improve the graphics, and the GUI in the future. But currently i have other work and projects to complete. However, I am trying to make little time daily to work on this 
project, and if there is any major changes, I will update the code on here.

Have fun playing!
